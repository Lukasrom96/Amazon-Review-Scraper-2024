# Amazon Review Scraper 2024

This repository contains a script for scraping Amazon reviews, which bypasses Amazon's limitation of displaying only 100 reviews per product by applying various filters. This allows for scraping up to 1500 product reviews per product variation (e.g., size). The following information is extracted for each review:

1. Customer name
2. Review title
3. Country of origin
4. Date
5. Product variation
6. Review text
7. Star rating
8. Number of likes

Each piece of information is individually extracted and written to a CSV file for further use after the scraping process.

To use the script, certain prerequisites are required. A complete guide is provided in the above notebook.

*The script is designed for german amazon and is also commented in german. If you have questions or need a translation message me on LinkedIn: https://de.linkedin.com/in/lukas-rommel-8917502aa*
